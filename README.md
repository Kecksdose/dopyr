`dopyr`: A small python framework to produce plots and do calculations commonly used in HEP.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Why `dopy`?
If you work in fields of high energy physics, you may need to produce *many* plots. You may apply different selections 
to them or train MVA classifiers to separate signal from background events. While spending time on this, you may find 
out that kFolding is a good idea or to weight different observables and see what changes.

All of the above can be achieved in a simple and clean way using `dopyr`.
